Targets are signified by <d> (dependecies) falling their name
'clean' and 'tar' commands are built into build, no need to create your own

CO (compile object) - short for g++ -c
COC (compile object with clang) - short for clang++ -c
LINK - short for g++ -o 'FIRST_TARGET_NAME' and links all the necessary .o files
LINKC - same as LINK but uses clang
anything else is used exactly as provided.
